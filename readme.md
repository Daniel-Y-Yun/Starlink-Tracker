# Starlink Tracker

## Introduction

A project designed to collect and display data, such as the location (i.e. Latitude and Longitude), elevation, and speed, of individual satellites from the Starlink satellite constellation
The satellites are broken down into groups by their launch dates. Users have the option of visualizing this data in a detailed table format or on a globe map. In the map visualization, users
can select a single satellite to see it’s x,y,z coordinates as well as its corresponding x,y,z velocities. The map also includes a feature to track that satellite’s path.
